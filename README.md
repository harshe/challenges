# Weekly Design Challenges

Every week, we will work on a challenge to build on the design and technical skills we are learning in class. 

Challenges are due in class the following week. At least five students will be randomly called on to present their work in class. Come to class ready to show and talk about your work.

If you need help, you can ask for it in the class [Slack](https://ar589ÃŸ.slack.com).
